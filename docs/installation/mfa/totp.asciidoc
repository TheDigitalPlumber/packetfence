//=== TOTP MFA

This section has been created to give a quick overview on how to configure TOTP MFA in PacketFence.

==== Assumptions

You have a phone where you have an MFA application compatible with TOTP (Akamai MFA, Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, DUO).

===== Create the Multi-Factor configuration

In this section we will configure the OTP MFA from the administration GUI.

Go in "Configuration->Integration->Multi-Factor Authentication" then click on new MFA and select TOTP.

In the form you have the following information to fill:

Name:
Define a name

RADIUS OTP Method:
It is where you define which method you want to use in RADIUS (Explaination are covered in the next section)

Character separator:
The character used to split the password and OTP when "Strip OTP" RADIUS method is selected.

Cache duration:
The amount of time PacketFence will store the MFA information of the user (used for "Strip OTP" and "Second Password Field" since PacketFence deal with multiples RADIUS reuqest)
